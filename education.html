            <h2>My Education</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>
                With over a decade of design, programming, and development experience, I have learned that the ability to self-educate is the most valuable asset I have. In a field such as this with ever
                changing and newly emerging technologies, education is never something that can be neglected. When formal education ends, that is when the real journey begins. This page introduces the knowledge and education that I have gained thus far, but it is important to 
                note that my mission is to <br><strong> Always Continue Learning. </strong> 
            </p>
            
            
            <h3>Formal Education</h3>
            <hr>
            <p>
                I graduated highschool in 2015, having taken 4 years of Java programming (including the AP Programming course) offered by my school. <br>
                In 2016, I attended VCU for four semesters in order to take higher level Math and Programming courses. <br>
                In 2022, I enrolled at Brightpoint Community College in order to obtain a certification in computer programming and web development. My graduation year will be 2023.<br>
                
            </p>
            <br>

            <h3>Self Education</h3>
            <hr>
            <p>
                I began programming in 2010 when I was 13. The focus of these efforts was game development, so I started with C++. As always I began with getting a language specific book, and supplemented that by referring to the documentation
                and using online learning resources. Throughout the years since, I have consistently added new languages, libraries,
                SDK's and API's to my skillset. For a full list of my technical skills, you may refer to the <a href = "about-me.html#techskills">Technical Skills</a> section of the About Me page.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h4>Approach</h4>
            <p>
                To acquire new skills and knowledge, I generally employ a project-based approach. I design an application or piece of software that will stretch the limits of what I currently know and necesitate
                the searching out of solutions. This approach is pracitical and effective because it promotes problem solving, active knowledge-seeking, and growth. The end result of the process is more knowledge, and 
                a finished project.
                I stated this earlier in the introductory section of this page, but I wish to reiterate with emphasis that this is my continuing journey: <br><strong> Always Continue Learning. </strong>
