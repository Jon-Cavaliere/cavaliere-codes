                <h2>Procedural 2D Lightning</h2>
                <p style="text-align:center">
                    This was a quick Unity project I created as a supplment to a game that I'm working on. The idea was to come up with an algorithm that could mimic the basic shape
                    of a bolt of lightning. I think the results are pretty cool. 
                </p>
                <h3>Features</h3>
                <p style="text-align:center">
                    The design that I came up with allows the specification of any two points, and the amount of generation steps. 
                    The program will generate a bolt between those two points at the specified level of "Jaggedity"
                </p>

                    I was responsible for this entire project from planning to implementation.
