                <h2>This Website!</h2>
                <p style="text-align:center">
                    The idea for the website began as a project for my ART-116 class at Brightpoint Community College. In this class I gained the skills necessary to design and develop a website
                    from scratch. It covered HTML and the basics of CSS. I took this as an opportunity to create something that I've been wanting for a while: My own digital space to put myself and
                    my work out there. To share insights as well as advertise my skills and capabilities. So, now it's here. I gained a CIW Web Development Associate certification through the process.

                <h3>Purpose</h3>
                <p style="text-align:center">
                    I wanted my project to be practical and extend well beyond the end of that class.
                    Now I have a platform to continue learning and experimenting with web development.

                <h3>My Reponsibilites</h3>
                <p style="text-align:center">
                    I was responsible for this entire project from planning to implementation.
